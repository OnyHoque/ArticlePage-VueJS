            I guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase "meant to be." That is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of 
            backwardly referential semantics and other mumbo-jumbo. Maybe such a discussion would result in the determination that "meant 
            to be" is exactly as meaningless a phrase as it seems to be, and that none of us is actually meant to be doing anything at all. 
            But that's my existential underpants underpinnings showing. It's the way the cookie crumbles. And now I want a cookie.

            There are only three ways to make this work. The first is to let me take care of everything. The second is for you to take 
            care of everything. The third is to split everything 50 / 50. I think the last option is the most preferable, but I'm certain 
            it'll also mean the end of our marriage.

            He had three simple rules by which he lived. The first was to never eat blue food. There was nothing in nature that was 
            edible that was blue. People often asked about blueberries, but everyone knows those are actually purple. He understood 
            it was one of the stranger rules to live by, but it had served him well thus far in the 50+ years of his life.

            Don't forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price. When you purchase a child the latest 
            smartphone, you're also committing to a monthly phone bill. When you purchase the latest gaming system, you're likely 
            not going to be satisfied with the games that come with it for long and want to purchase new titles to play. When you 
            buy gifts it's important to remember that some come with additional costs down the road that can be much more expensive
             than the initial gift itself.
